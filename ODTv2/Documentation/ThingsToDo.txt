Project title - Online drawing tool

Build uniform UI for the tool - 
    - UI for User
        - pick the domain 
            - objects bar (drag and drop to draw)
                - properties of the object (right click, eg: set resisitance value)
            - toolbar
                - save, load, draw lines, (uniform options = resize, color, etc .. like in paint)
            - additional functionality (do something with the diagram, eg: run circuit)

    - config files for expert 
        - path to input
             images
                - csv(domain/expert, images)
                - csv(user, images)  
        - path to object properties 
            - file which states the properties of each obj explicitly 
            - dict(building-block : right-click options)
            - called by functions of the interface
        - path to provide basic functionality
            - how to save the diagram 
            - define the formal method
            - how to reload
        - path to additional functionalities
            - evaluate circuit
            - do anything the expert feels is required
        - path to output images(objects)
             images
                - csv(domain/expert, images)
                - csv(user, images) 
             data structure
                - json(domain/expert,)
                - json(user, images)

Problem statement: 

To design a generic graphic drawing tool that supports construction, analysis and evaluation of technical diagrams. 
To allow construction of diagrams from predefined building-blocks.
To allow analysis and evaluation of diagrams from predefined functionalities. 



Parameters
    - obj id
    - class - type
    - x,y coordinates of all corners of image wrt canvas
    - size
    - rotation angle
    - properties of image, set by user - like resistance value, color (depends on each obj)
    - object label (set by user, can be a property of image)
    - depth (incase of overlaps)
    - any additional properties (added for sake of convenience or implementation)
