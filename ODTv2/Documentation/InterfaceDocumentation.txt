Interface documentation

Each Component has following properties:
    id - unique id for each component
    domain - domain it belongs to
    value - value associated with the component if any
    type - type of component eg:type of gate, state or transition
    x_coordinate - decide if one coordinate or multiple coordinates
    y_coordinate 
    label - as specified by user
    size
    rotation
    color
    depth - incase of overlapping images

Util functions - independent of domain
    save(data, filename, path) 
        - returns nothing
        - saves both components and connectivity
    reload(filename, path) 
        - returns components, connectivity
        - reloads both components and connectivity 

Domain specific implementation
    - init(components, connectivity)
        - creates the component objects etc
    - set_connectivity
        - creates domain specific connectivity structure

Additional functions - LD
    - compute at point specified
    - take inputs at specified points
    - simplify

Additional functions - TOC
    - if string belongs to language
    - state sequence
